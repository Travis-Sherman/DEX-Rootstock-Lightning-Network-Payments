## Project Title
### Decentralized Exchange on Rootstock with High-Throughput Data Oracles and Lightning Network Payments

## Project Description
### A decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Rootstock sidechain, utilizing Anduro's high-throughput data oracles for real-time price feeds and Lightspark's Lightning Network integration for fast, low-cost transactions. The project includes a React frontend, Node.js backend, and smart contracts deployed on the Rootstock sidechain.

Track and Sidechain Selection
Track: Sidechain Track
Sidechain: Rootstock (RSK)
Detailed Project Description
Problem Addressed
Centralized exchanges are prone to security breaches, high fees, and lack of transparency. There is a need for a secure, decentralized platform that provides real-time price data and efficient transaction processing.

Solution Developed
A DEX on Rootstock that leverages Anduro's data oracles for accurate price feeds and integrates Lightspark to facilitate fast, low-cost Bitcoin transactions via the Lightning Network.

Technologies Used
Rootstock (RSK): For the sidechain infrastructure and smart contract capabilities.
Anduro: For high-throughput data oracles to provide real-time price feeds.
Lightspark: For integrating Lightning Network payments.
Features
Decentralized Exchange: Users can trade Bitcoin and other assets in a decentralized manner.
Real-Time Price Feeds: Leveraging Anduro's data oracles for accurate and timely price information.
Lightning Network Payments: Integrating Lightspark for fast and low-cost transactions.
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm
Hardhat
MetaMask or another Ethereum-compatible wallet
Smart Contract Deployment
Install Hardhat

bash
Copy code
npm install --save-dev hardhat
Create Hardhat Project

bash
Copy code
npx hardhat
Select "Create a basic sample project".

Install Dependencies

bash
Copy code
npm install @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai
Configure hardhat.config.js

javascript
Copy code
require('@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle');
require('@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers');

module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.0",
  networks: {
    rsk: {
      url: `https://public-node.rsk.co`, // Rootstock mainnet
      accounts: [`0x${YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY}`]
    },
    rskTestnet: {
      url: `https://public-node.testnet.rsk.co`, // Rootstock testnet
      accounts: [`0x${YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY}`]
    }
  }
};
Create and Compile the Contract
Place DecentralizedExchange.sol in the contracts directory.

Create Deployment Script
Create a scripts/deploy.js file:

javascript
Copy code
async function main() {
  const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();
  console.log("Deploying contracts with the account:", deployer.address);

  const balance = await deployer.getBalance();
  console.log("Account balance:", balance.toString());

  const DecentralizedExchange = await ethers.getContractFactory("DecentralizedExchange");
  const exchange = await DecentralizedExchange.deploy();
  console.log("Contract deployed to address:", exchange.address);
}

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
Deploy the Contract

bash
Copy code
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rskTestnet
Backend Setup
